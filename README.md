CSIT455- Object/Relational Database

Using PHP 5.4, project utilizes the Oracle Call Interface (OCI) to connect to an off-site Oracle server. 
Development server hosted locally on a Zend Community Server- Apache with built-in OCI libraries.

Original design pattern implementation by Christopher Becker and Fusion Computer Development.

Note:
Site prefix, defined in /trunk/includes/site.inc assumes that the main directory of the project from the server root is /trunk/, modify as needed.
